<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Have you ever pondered how the worth of road safety is gauged by
economists, or in other words, how they determine the value of a human
life in these analyses?</p>
<p>The <strong>Value of Statistical Life</strong> (VSL) is a fascinating
concept used to tackle these questions, especially when it comes to
making our roads safer. Instead of putting a price tag on life itself,
VSL estimates how much people are collectively willing to spend to
reduce the risk of fatal accidents. For instance, if a group is ready to
pay <code>$</code>50 each for a safety feature that lessens the chance
of a fatal car accident by 1 in 100,000, then the VSL is pegged at
<code>$</code>5 million (<code>$</code>50 x 100,000). This calculation
helps in assessing whether the cost of road safety measures, like new
traffic signals or stricter speed enforcement, is justified by the
benefits, namely saving lives and preventing injuries. It’s a way for
decision-makers to prioritise safety measures and make informed choices,
ensuring that investments in safety deliver the most <em>bang for the
buck</em> in protecting our communities.</p>
<p>How could modellers estimate the amount of money that <strong>people
are collectively willing to spend to reduce road cashes</strong> and
<strong>the chance of involving in a certain type of road crash</strong>
such as fatal or major injury that requires hospitalisation? Economists
term these concepts a <strong>Willingness To Pay</strong> (WTP) value
and a <strong>crash probability</strong>, respectively. These are the
two vital inputs for the estimation of the VSL.</p>
<p>What do we need the estimate these values? Two things, really. High
quality data and good behavioural models.</p>
</div>
<div id="collecting-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Collecting data</h2>
<p>Collecting high quality data is time-consuming and this is the reason
why this project takes more than 5 years from inception (2017) to
completion (2024). Obviously, the Covid-19 pandemic severely delayed and
disrupted the study. Not withstanding this, multiple waves of data
collection, from pilots in selected states to a national studies, took a
lot of time. Multiple survey administration methods, including online
self-guided to online-guided and face2face interviews were tested to
select the most appropriate method that delivers high quality data
within the budget and timeline.</p>
<div id="survey-administration-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey administration methods</h3>
<p>This study marks the first attempt to use a WTP (Willingness to Pay)
approach to simultaneously estimate national values for time,
reliability, and safety in road travel. As these values are being
determined for the first time, significant time and effort were invested
in the design, testing, and review phases before launching a
comprehensive national survey.</p>
<p>The survey comprises three phases: design, pilots, and national
survey (wave 1 and wave 2) with cognitive interviews and feedback
between phases to improve the survey instruments. Overall, nothing beats
face2face interviews, which had to be replaced with online-guided
interviews in Wave 2 of the national survey due to <em>physical
distancing</em> measures imposed by Covid-19.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-stated-choice-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>The Stated Choice Experiment</h3>
<p>Centred to this national study of WTP is a SP experiment that face
the participants five sets of route choices, each choice consisted of
two options. The two options had varying estimates of safety, cost, and
travel time, where travel time was given as a range to reflect differing
reliabilities (see Figure below).</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/WTP_SP.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>The attribute levels (cost, time, reliability, and safety) of the
choice experiments were chosen using <em>Bayesian efficient
designs</em>. These optimise the attribute levels based on each
respondent’s reported trip details obtained from the background
questions that preceed the SP experiment. The aim of the <em>Bayesian
efficient designs</em> is to minimise the standard deviations of errors
in the model coefficient estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="survey-sampling" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey sampling</h3>
<p>The survey used a <strong>stratification sampling with quota</strong>
to obtain enough sampels for the requirement of separate WTP values for
different travel purposes. Samples are proportionate to the population
of each State/Territory. Quotas were also employed for jurisdictions,
drivers and passengers, and metropolitan and regional locations to
ensure the survey results accurately represented nationwide
averages.</p>
<p>In the field work, recruitment took place in both urban and regional
settings so that travellers outside major (capital) cities would also be
included. The split of the samples (i.e., respondents) between urban
vs. rural location was matched with corresponding statistics derived
from the <a
href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/australias-journey-work">ABS 2016
Census Journey to Work (JTW)</a> to obtain an expansion factor (i.e.,
weight) for each observation. In the absence of reliable statistics on
urban/rural split for business and non-work trip purpose, the matching
process used statistics for the Census JTW data for all trip purposes.
The WTP values estimated from the model were then aggregated using the
expansion factors to give weighted average values that could be used
consistently for all travellers in all parts of Australia.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-sample-size" class="section level3">
<h3>Final sample size</h3>
<p>The National Survey captured a large sample of respondents and
provided enough variation to ensure reliable and statistically
significant results. However, the sample for the National Survey had
approximately 650 fewer participants than initially planned, as some
segments such as business travel and passenger trips in regional areas
were extremely difficult to find post Covid-19. The figure below shows
the shortfall of the final sample vs. targeted number.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/data_collection_segment_quota2022-12-13.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Thus, an effort was made to use the pilot sample as much as possible.
This was to bring the total sample closer to the target number. To make
up for the shortfall, the 289 face-to-face interviews from the pilot
phases were included and pooled with the results from Wave 1 for model
development and estimation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="collecting-crash-probability-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Collecting crash probability data</h2>
<p>The crash probability, measuring the risk of exposing to road crashes
is needed to estimate the WTP for reducing the number of crashes by one,
for each severity class. Five severity classifications were represented
in the survey. They correspond with fatal, incapacitating, major, minor
injury and property damage only. Comparing to the classifications used
by Australian jurisdictions, the study introduced the incapacitating
injury which was considered necessary because the range of severities
for hospitalised injuries is very large, ranging from an overnight stay
to life-long incapacity.</p>
<p>The survey instrument presented the numbers of crashes in each
severity category along the route of the trip over a period of a year.
If the modelling was undertaken using SP data alone, the WTP value
obtained would be WTP per trip for a reduction in the number of crashes,
in a given severity category by one per year. This is termed the
<strong>subjective value of crash risk reduction</strong> (SVCR).</p>
<p>For a given crash severity, the <strong>Value of Risk
Reduction</strong> (VRR) is obtained by multiplying the SVCR by the
level of crash exposure (number of opportunities for a crash) in a year.
The exposure measure for each trip per annum was taken as the
distance-weighted <strong>average annual daily traffic (AADT)</strong>
level times 365 along the route of the trip. As the level of crash
exposure varies between trips, the conversion was undertaken at the
individual trip level. The number of crashes in each survey response was
divided by the distance-weighted AADT times 365 for the trip to convert
it to the annual probability of a crash occurring. The WTP value
estimated from data expressed in crash probabilities is then the
required VRR.</p>
<p>Transport authorities from various states and territories provided
AADT data, which was standardised and indexed by year. Transport
authorities in Australia estimate the AADT using traffic count data
obtained from counters placed at various points/stations across the road
networks. The location of these counters, and hence data coverage of the
AADT, is shown in the Figure below.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/aadt_map.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Survey respondents were asked to provide the suburb of origin and
destination of their trips, allowing for an optimal route (shortest
time) to be determined through Google Maps. There were 3,885 unique
routes identified for all origin-destination pairs, across all surveyed
people, excluding intra-zonal trips. The reported trips span a wide
geographical area of Australia and spread between urban and regional
areas. AADTs for segments along the route for each trip were estimated
for all identified routes across the entire survey sample. Since the
AADT varies over the length of the route for each trip, the
distance-weighted average was taken after snapping the traffic count
data to each route and split it up to segments. The Figure below shows
an example route between Bankstown and Mount Druitt in Sydney which went
through a few traffic counters that provide the AADT data.</p>

<div id="developing-behavioural-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Developing behavioural models</h2>
<p>When it comes to model development, there is no shortcut. It is an
interactively process of testing different model specifications,
validating the results, and selecting the best models based firstly on
their <em>behavioural outputs</em> (elasticity, willingness to pay,
marginal rate of substitution) and secondly on statistical tests such as
model <em>goodness of fit</em>. Literal, hundreds of models have been
estimated such that the best one can be found. While automation and
programming help us make this process a bit less daunting, there is
really no shortcut.</p>

<h1>Navigating COVID-19 with Data Analytics</h1>
<p>2021-08-29 Last compiled: 2024-03-09</p>
<p>While Sydneysiders were in lockdowns, Enlightened Data embarked on a
critical mission during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Harnessing the power of advanced data visualization, our team developed
an intuitive, real-time tracking tool that painted a vivid picture of
the virus’s spread across the city. This innovative platform not only
provided citizens and health authorities with an immediate understanding
of outbreak hotspots but also enabled the strategic deployment of
healthcare resources and the implementation of targeted lockdown
measures. Through this project, Enlightened Data demonstrated the
impactful role of data visualization in managing public health crises,
offering a beacon of clarity amidst the uncertainty of a global
pandemic.</p>
<div id="the-strict-lockdown-in-sydney-metropolitan-area"

<h2>The strict lockdown in Sydney Metropolitan area</h2>
<p>Starting in an Eastern suburb of Randwick, Delta quickly spread to
Fairfield and sent this Local Government Areas (LGA) and adjacent areas
to a strict lockdown in mid July 2021. Residents of these areas were
ordered to stay strictly inside their home and can only go out for
<em>essential purposes</em> such as going to work, education, grocery
shopping, and medical purposes. Schools and playgrounds were closed to
reduce the risk of Delta spreading further. In addition, families of the
so-called LGA of concerns were only allowed to do exercise for
<strong>up-to one-hour outside their homes and they must be wearing a
facemask</strong>. This was perhaps the darkest period of Sydney
lockdown.</p>
</div>
<div id="sydney-lockdown-2021-was-it-too-little-too-late"
class="section level2">
<h2>Sydney lockdown 2021: Was it too little too late?</h2>
<p><em>2021-08-29</em></p>
<p>Apparently so. But there is little point of criticizing the NSW
government for what they did not know at the time (that Delta is a
game-changer). With the Greater Sydney is in week #10 of lockdown, is
there something that the NSW government can learn to slow Delta spread,
first to buy time to vaccine us out of the current lockdown, and second
to reduce the pressure on our healthcare systems. The answer is yes,
based on an analysis of locally acquired cases shown in the Figure
below. We suggest two pressing moves to avoid the same mistake and buy
us time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Camden to the LGA of concern NOW. NSW Health has been watching
Camden, but I wonder what they are waiting for.</li>
<li>Change the cases tracking from 14-day to 7-day rolling total and
half the trigger (50 to 25 or 30) to allow quicker responses.</li>
<li>(Bonus) Closely watch Randwick, Inner West and Sydney.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/covid19_lga.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the last 7 days, Camden has more than 100 cases per 100,000
residents, twice the adopted threshold that would trigger for any area
to go back into lockdown, according to the State plans to implement a
staggered return for schools from 25 October 2021. The evidence,
interpreted below, suggests that it may have been too late for Camden (I
would bet my money for this).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fairfield was under ‘the ring of steel’ on 17 July when the total
local cases in the prior seven days were 179 cases per 100,000
residents. The LGA has seen cases reduced, but when restrictions were
relaxed (eg no more requirement to test every 3 days for most authorised
workers), cases started to increase again, and is now standing at the
same level at when it was entered the strictest restrictions.</li>
<li>Canterbury-Bankstown and Liverpool, both share their borders with
Fairfield, also entered the lockdown on the same date (17 July) when
cases were low (18 &amp; 20) but with fewer restrictions (authorised
workers didn’t need tests every 3 days). By the time they were bearing
the same restrictions in early August, cases per 100,000 residents had
approximated or exceeded 100, and have increased since, rapidly!</li>
<li>Cumberland was added to the list of concern quite early when cases
per 100,000 residents was only 11. But since cases exceeded 100, they
increased rapidly and is now at the centre of the NSW outbreak (cases
per resident increased 3 times in less than 4 weeks).</li>
<li>Burwood, Georges River, and Bayside have been resilient in keeping
cases under 100 per 100,000 residents. ALL entered a stricter lockdown
when cases were low (20, 23, and 36), so were Parramatta and
Campbelltown LGAs (17 and 27). The last two LGAs have been successfully,
to some extent, in keeping the cases below 100 for nearly 10 weeks,
buying precious time for vaccination. In comparison, Strathfield entered
lockdown at 45, which took less than 5 weeks to reach 100.</li>
<li>Camden is now at the breaking point.</li>

<p>We have warned a week ago that NSW Health should pay close attention
to the spread of Delta in Sydney, Randwick and Inner West LGAs. Two of
these three LGAs are now seeing cases increased rapidly. Who knows what

<h2>How quickly Delta strain spread to regional NSW</h2>

<p>Have NSW cases peaked? Likely so, but that varies by where you were
in NSW. In most of the 12 LGAs of concern, cases trended down in the
last two weeks. In Central Coast and South Coast, however, cases are
still increasing rapidly.</p>
