<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Have you ever pondered how the worth of road safety is gauged by
economists, or in other words, how they determine the value of a human
life in these analyses?</p>
<p>The <strong>Value of Statistical Life</strong> (VSL) is a fascinating
concept used to tackle these questions, especially when it comes to
making our roads safer. Instead of putting a price tag on life itself,
VSL estimates how much people are collectively willing to spend to
reduce the risk of fatal accidents. For instance, if a group is ready to
pay $50 each for a safety feature that lessens the chance of a fatal car
accident by 1 in 100,000, then the VSL is pegged at $5 million ($50 x
100,000). This calculation helps in assessing whether the cost of road
safety measures, like new traffic signals or stricter speed enforcement,
is justified by the benefits, namely saving lives and preventing
injuries. It’s a way for decision-makers to prioritise safety measures
and make informed choices, ensuring that investments in safety deliver
the most <em>bang for the buck</em> in protecting our communities.</p>
<p>How can modelers estimate the amount of money that <strong>people are
collectively willing to spend to reduce road crashes</strong> and
<strong>the likelihood of being involved in a certain type of road
crash</strong>, such as one that is fatal or results in major injury
requiring hospitalization? Economists refer to these concepts as a
<strong>Willingness To Pay</strong> (WTP) value and a <strong>crash
probability</strong>, respectively. These are two crucial inputs for
estimating the VSL.</p>
<p>What do we need to estimate these values? Essentially two things:
high-quality data and robust behavioral models.</p>
</div>
<div id="collecting-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Collecting data</h2>
<p>Collecting high-quality data is time-consuming, which is why this
project has taken more than five years from its inception in 2017 to its
completion in 2024. Clearly, the COVID-19 pandemic severely delayed and
disrupted the study. Despite this, multiple waves of data collection,
from pilots in selected states to national studies, took a considerable
amount of time. Various survey administration methods, including online
self-guided, online-guided, and face-to-face interviews, were tested to
select the most appropriate method that delivers high-quality data
within the budget and timeline.</p>
<div id="survey-administration-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey administration methods</h3>
<p>This study marks the first attempt to use a WTP (Willingness to Pay)
approach to simultaneously estimate national values for time,
reliability, and safety in road travel. As these values are being
determined for the first time, significant time and effort were invested
in the design, testing, and review phases before launching a
comprehensive national survey.</p>
<p>The survey comprises three phases: design, pilots, and national
survey (Wave 1 and Wave 2), with cognitive interviews and feedback
between phases to improve the survey instruments. Overall, nothing beats
face-to-face interviews, which had to be replaced with online-guided
interviews in Wave 2 of the national survey due to <em>physical
distancing</em> measures imposed by COVID-19.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-stated-choice-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>The Stated Choice Experiment</h3>
<p>At the core of this national WTP (Willingness to Pay) study is an SP
(Stated Preference) experiment that presents participants with five sets
of route choices, each comprising two options. These options vary in
terms of safety, cost, and travel time, with travel time presented as a
range to account for different reliabilities (refer to the figure
below).</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/WTP_SP.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>The attribute levels (cost, time, reliability, and safety) of the
choice experiments were chosen using <em>Bayesian efficient
designs</em>. These designs optimise the attribute levels based on the
trip details reported by each respondent from the background questions
preceding the SP experiment. The goal of the Bayesian efficient designs
is to minimize the errors in the model coefficient estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="survey-sampling" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey sampling</h3>
<p>The survey used a <strong>stratification sampling with quota</strong>
to obtain enough samples for the requirement of separate WTP values for
different travel purposes. Samples are proportional to the population of
each State/Territory. Quotas were also employed for jurisdictions,
drivers and passengers, and metropolitan and regional locations to
ensure the survey results accurately represented nationwide
averages.</p>
<p>In the fieldwork, recruitment took place in both urban and regional
settings so that travelers outside major (capital) cities would also be
included. The split of the samples (i.e., respondents) between urban
vs. rural locations was matched with corresponding statistics derived
from the <a
href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/australias-journey-work">ABS 2016
Census Journey to Work (JTW)</a> to obtain an expansion factor (i.e.,
weight) for each observation. In the absence of reliable statistics on
the urban/rural split for business and non-work trip purposes, the
matching process used statistics from the Census JTW data for all trip
purposes. The WTP values estimated from the model were then aggregated
using the expansion factors to give weighted average values that could
be used consistently for all travellers in all parts of Australia.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-sample-size" class="section level3">
<h3>Final sample size</h3>
<p>The National Survey captured a large sample of respondents, providing
sufficient variation to ensure reliable and statistically significant
results. However, the sample size for the National Survey was
approximately 650 participants fewer than initially planned, due to
challenges in finding certain segments, such as business travel and
passenger trips in regional areas, post-COVID-19. The figure below
illustrates the shortfall of the final sample compared to the targeted
number.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/data_collection_segment_quota2022-12-13.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Therefore, we endeavor to utilize the pilot samples as much as
possible, bringing the total number of samples closer to the target
figure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="collecting-crash-probability-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Collecting crash probability data</h2>
<p>The crash probability, which measures the risk of being involved in
road crashes, is necessary for estimating the WTP (Willingness to Pay)
to reduce the number of crashes by one for each severity class. The
survey included five severity classifications: fatal, incapacitating,
major, minor injury, and property damage only. Compared to
classifications used by Australian jurisdictions, this study introduced
the category of incapacitating injury, deemed necessary to account for
the broad range of hospitalization severities, from overnight stays to
lifelong incapacities.</p>
<p>The survey instrument displayed the number of crashes in each
severity category along the route of the trip over a year. If the
modeling were conducted using only SP (Stated Preference) data, the
derived WTP value would represent the WTP per trip for reducing the
number of crashes in a specific severity category by one per year. This
concept is known as the <strong>subjective value of crash risk
reduction</strong> (SVCR), which essentially measures how much
<strong>people are collectively willing to spend to reduce road
crashes</strong>.</p>
<p>For each crash severity, the <strong>Value of Risk Reduction
(VRR)</strong> (or <strong>VSL</strong> if it is a fatal risk) is
calculated by multiplying the SVCR by the level of crash exposure
(number of opportunities for a crash). The exposure measure for each
trip per year was determined as the distance-weighted <strong>average
annual daily traffic</strong> (AADT) level multiplied by 365 (number of
days in a year) for the trip’s route. Since crash exposure varies
between trips, this conversion was performed at the individual trip
level. The number of crashes/year shown in the SP experiment was divided
by the distance-weighted AADT multiplied by 365 for the trip to convert
it into the <strong>annual probability of a crash</strong> occurring.
The WTP value estimated from data expressed in crash probabilities then
becomes the required VRR, with no further conversion being needed.</p>
<p>Transport authorities from various states and territories supplied
AADT data, which was standardised and indexed by year. In Australia,
transport authorities calculate the AADT using traffic count data from
counters placed at various locations across the road networks. The
placement of these counters, and consequently the data coverage of the
AADT, is illustrated in the figure below.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p><img src="images/aadt_map_small.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>It is worth noting that two alternative methods exist for estimating
the VRR or VSL (<strong>$/crash</strong>) using the WTP values derived
from the choice model. The first method, adopted by <a
href="https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/19286/1/itls_wp_09_03.pdf">Hensher
et al. (2009)</a> in the RTA pilot study (whose WTP estimates have been
used in ATAP guidelines), first estimated the SVCR (or WTP
(<strong>$/year</strong>) to reduce 1 road crash of type <em>i</em> per
year). The SVCR values were then converted to VRR or VSL using an
<em>average crash exposure</em> estimated from data for <em>the entire
road network</em> (in the case of the RTA report, it is the NSW road
network). The second method, adopted by <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457501000823">Rizzi
and Ortuzar (2003)</a>, converted the numbers of crashes per annum
(which differ <em>systematically</em> across respondents according to
the SP designs) into crash probabilities by dividing the annual crash
numbers presented in the SP experiments by the traffic volume along each
route prior to estimating the choice models. Choice models that use
crash probability deliver the VRR or VSL without further conversion
needed. The first approach is easier, as it requires only the
jurisdiction-wide average crash exposure; however, this approach may not
be satisfactory for a large country like Australia where trips vary
markedly by distance, traffic exposure level, and condition of roads.
Upon consulting with Prof. Ortuzar and independent reviewers from Leeds
University, the Austroads Project Managers decided to adopt the second
method for estimating the VRR. To what extent the VRR / VSL derived by
these alternative methods differ remains a question that needs to be
investigated further.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimating-risk-exposure-for-each-trip" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimating risk exposure for each trip</h2>
<p>Once traffic volume data have been obtained, we need to map this to
each trip/route so that crash probabilities can be computed. This is a
massive task because we have thousands of routes and tens of thousands
of traffic counters across Australia. A programming method is needed
because a manual approach would take a very long time (first by
digitizing the route, then by mapping the AADT data to each route, and
finally by calculating the distance-weighted AADT for each route).</p>
<p>Survey respondents were asked to provide the suburbs of origin and
destination for their trips, enabling the determination of an optimal
route (shortest time) via Google Maps. A total of 3,885 unique routes
were identified for all origin-destination pairs among the surveyed
individuals, excluding intra-zonal trips. The reported trips covered a
broad geographical area of Australia, ranging from urban to regional
locations. AADTs for the route segments of each trip were estimated for
all identified routes observed in the entire survey sample. Given that
the AADT varies along each trip’s route, a distance-weighted average was
calculated after mapping the traffic count data to each route and
dividing it into segments. The figure below illustrates the developed
method, using an example route from Bankstown to Mount Druitt in Sydney,
which passed through several traffic counters (represented by dots) that
provide AADT data (shaded in different colours).</p>

<div id="developing-behavioural-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Developing behavioural models</h2>
<p>When it comes to model development, there are no shortcuts. We used
an iterative process of testing different model specifications,
validating the results, and selecting the best models based primarily on
their <em>behavioural outputs</em> (elasticity, willingness to pay,
marginal rate of substitution) and secondarily on statistical tests such
as model <em>goodness of fit</em>. Literally, hundreds of models have
been estimated to find the best one. Although automation and programming
can make this process somewhat less daunting, there are truly no
shortcuts.</p>

<div id="estimating-the-vsl" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimating the VSL</h2>
<p>Once the best model has been found, we can use it to derive the
economic values, which in this case, are the value of risk reduction or
VSL. <a

will publish these values in due course for the estimation of benefits

<div id="objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The amenity benefits derived from the improved urban realm in station
precincts are increasingly recognized as a critical part of a transport
project’s development and are receiving more focus from project teams.
However, the approaches to valuing and incorporating these
considerations into project option design and business cases are not
suitable for the modern-day Australian context.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, Sydney Metro engaged Deloitte Access
Economics and Enlightened Data to develop contemporary WTP (Willingness
to Pay) values for amenity benefits from improved public realm
attributes in station precincts. The WTP values were to be derived in
units that were more suitable for their intended purpose, such as on a
per householder or per trip basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level2">
<h2>Data collection</h2>
<p>We use SP (Stated Preference) surveys to understand how people might
behave in different environments within a station precinct. In these
experiments, respondents are asked to choose between different options
that exhibit both desirable and undesirable characteristics. We design a
Best-Worst experiment based on the review of similar studies and input
from the clients.</p>
<p>We collaborate with Taverner, who recruited and conducted
face-to-face surveys across 10 stations in Sydney. The interview
locations and respondents are shown in the figure below. These locations
were chosen to encompass the geography of Greater Sydney as well as to
include different types of station users such as residents, visitors,
and non-rail users.</p>

<h2>Analysis method</h2>
<div id="best-worst-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Best-Worst model</h3>
<p>Numerous models were tested and estimated. The best model, identified
through log-likelihood ratio tests, took the form of a Best-Worst
Generalized Mixed Logit model type II, also known as a hybrid model of
scaled MNL (Multinomial Logit) and mixed logit. With a sample size of
over 400 respondents, the Best-Worst survey and modeling technique help
us double the number of observations, which in turn delivers more
reliable parameters and, consequently, more accurate WTP (Willingness to
Pay) values.</p>
</div>
<div id="catchment-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Catchment analysis</h3>
<p>Once the WTP values were estimated, we needed to apply these values
to the case of Sydney. To achieve this, a catchment analysis was
conducted to estimate the monthly number of train trips per visitor and
per resident, respectively. An example is illustrated in the figure
below.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>For the application of these WTP (Willingness to Pay) values in
business cases and economic appraisals, it is essential to convert the
WTP estimates provided by the best model into value per use (i.e.,
$/train trip). Catchment analyses were conducted using four alternative
catchments of 500m, 800m, 1000m, and 1200m walking distances from each
of the 10 interview locations. The resulting catchments were then
overlaid with Sydney HTS (Household Travel Survey) data to estimate the
average number of train trips per household per month. The 500m
catchment yielded the highest average number of monthly train trips per
household (31.72). For catchments ranging from 800m to 1200m, the
average number of monthly train trips per household stabilized at around
27 trips/household/month.</p>
<p>Using this average, we calculate the average WTP per use for rail
users. To estimate the annual non-use value in business cases, one can
simply multiply the $/household/month by 12 months and the total number
of non-rail households residing within the station precinct (e.g.,
within 1km).</p>
