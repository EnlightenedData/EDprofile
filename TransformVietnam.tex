Apart from providing commercial services, we at \textbf{Enlightened
Data} proudly contribute free services to the community. Below, we share
one of our latest effort --- a project that not only builds data, but
also builds bridges for the betterment of Vietnam.

\subsection{üåâ Background}\label{background}}

Twenty years ago, I was a young civil engineer and lecturer at Vietnam
National University, HCMC University of Technology leading students to
the Mekong Delta to \textbf{build concrete bridges for poor
communities}. We ate simple meals, slept on the ground, bathed in
rivers, and drank homemade rice wine --- just to help children cross
monkey bridges safely to reach school.

Twenty years later, I no longer live or work in Vietnam --- but I still
build bridges. Not in Tra Vinh, but in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City.
Not with concrete and steel, but with \textbf{code and data}. This time,
I built a \textbf{GTFS Bridge} --- Generic Transit Feed Specification
--- a digital foundation to help HCMC step into the future of smart
mobility.

Did you know?

\begin{quote}
Apps like Google Maps, BusMap, Transit App, etc. all need GTFS data to
work.
\end{quote}

But while Google and BusMap have some data, \textbf{our own city
departments don't}.

When I asked former students (now working at the Department of
Transport), colleagues, even HCMGIS, everyone shook their heads:
\emph{``We don't have the GIS data needed for GTFS.''}

So I rolled up my sleeves and did it myself.

I wrote the scripts. I scraped the data from public websites. I
processed everything alone.

It took \textbf{almost a month}, the same time it took to build those
concrete bridges decades ago. But this time, there were no civil
engineering students, no local officials, no community volunteers.

Meanwhile, in Ha Noi, the World Bank funded GTFS development in a three
years (and it's still incomplete). But HCMC --- proudly to be Vietnam's
economic powerhouse, innovation hub, and free trade zone --- still had
nothing.

Now, I've created the first \textbf{draft GTFS dataset for HCMC}.
\href{https://github.com/EnlightenedData/EDprofile/tree/master/data/HCMC_PTnetwork.gdb.zip}{Click
here to download a zipped Geodatabase that contain bus and metro stops
\& lines in HCMC}

With GTFS, you can:

‚úÖ \textbf{Map bus and metro networks} with one click (or a few lines of
code)\\
‚úÖ \textbf{Integrate data} into navigation apps, TOD (Transit-Oriented
Development) research, transport models, social equity analysis\\
‚úÖ \textbf{Advance Vietnam's digital transformation} in urban and
transport systems

As our ancestors said:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Without flour, you can't make paste.''} Vietnamese proverb
\end{quote}

In the digital age, \textbf{data is the flour}. With data, we build
bridges. With bridges, we create hope.

\subsection{üåü A Call to Vietnam's Government, Researchers, Developers,
and Data
Owners}\label{a-call-to-vietnams-government-researchers-developers-and-data-owners}}

We at \textbf{Enlightened Data} invite you --- \textbf{government
agencies, researchers, urban planners, developers, students, and data
owners} --- to \textbf{join the Open Data movement}.

Share your datasets. Use Open Standards. Contribute to Vietnam's
\textbf{Open Data Portal}.

Why?

Because \textbf{open data powers innovation}. It helps us solve
real-world problems, from traffic congestion and air pollution to public
service access and urban equity.

If one volunteer can build a GTFS bridge alone, imagine what \textbf{we
can build together}.

The bridge is built. Whether we cross it --- \textbf{depends on all of
us}.

Let's \textbf{open the doors to data} and \textbf{unlock the future of
Vietnam}.

üëâ \emph{The GTFS bundle for HCMC is made public via}
\href{https://github.com/EnlightenedData/EDprofile/tree/master/data}{GitHub}.

\emph{``Open data is not just about transparency. It's about empowering
people, driving innovation, and building a better world.''}
